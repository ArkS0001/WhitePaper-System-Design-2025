# WhitePaper-System-Design-2025

These 8 whitepapers will teach you more about Databases & System Design than any $5000 BootCamp ever will... (A must-read for interviews & leveling up your knowledge) 

There are insights here that will give you great perspective on good engineering. 

 1️⃣ Google Bigtable: https://lnkd.in/dcESCPDF
- Built to handle Google’s massive database needs with high performance and scalability. 
- Inspired the architecture of modern NoSQL databases like HBase and Cassandra. 

 2️⃣ Amazon Dynamo: https://lnkd.in/djcQnzAG
- Amazon’s solution for building a shopping cart that is always writable, ensuring a seamless customer experience. 
- Introduced eventual consistency and decentralized leaderless replication, transforming the database world. 

 3️⃣ Amazon DynamoDB (2022 Update): https://lnkd.in/d7-n_MTR
- A modern take on Dynamo with features like tunable consistency and single-leader replication. 
- Packed with lessons from over a decade of running a globally distributed database. 

 4️⃣ Apache Cassandra: https://lnkd.in/dGsRuaHC
- Developed by Facebook for inbox search, offering high write throughput using LSM trees. 
- Avoids Global Secondary Indexes and excels at blazing-fast writes and reads when partition keys are used. 

 5️⃣ Spanner (Google): (https://lnkd.in/eqbsdEuJ) 
- Introduced the concept of a globally distributed database with strong consistency. 
- Powered innovations like TrueTime for handling distributed transactions. 

 6️⃣ CockroachDB: https://lnkd.in/efuHC5_d
- Heavily inspired by Spanner but made to run on commodity hardware. 
- Ideal for building fault-tolerant, scalable systems with strong consistency. 

 7️⃣ Raft Consensus Algorithm: (https://lnkd.in/e3A9YEQw) 
- Simplifies distributed consensus, making it more understandable compared to Paxos. 
- Widely adopted in distributed systems like Kubernetes (ETCD) and Kafka. 

 8️⃣ Paxos Made Simple: (https://lnkd.in/eSRMTEUh) 
- A foundational paper on consensus algorithms in distributed systems. 
- Provides the backbone for many distributed databases and systems.
